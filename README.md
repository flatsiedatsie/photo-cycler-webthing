# photo-cycler-webthing

Simple web thing that cycles through a photo directory, updating the current image periodically.

This was created as an example of how to set up custom routes through the server and to create a custom UI for your web thing.

## Running

Drop a bunch of pictures (.jpg) in the photos folder, pick your desired language (python, node, java, rust), and run the `run.sh` script inside that directory.
